About 90 minutes ago, I was introduced with a new topic called "Design Patterns" in Software Engineering. In all honesty it was a little rough for me to understand what it actually meant. But this is how I visualize a type of design pattern: Building a brand new desktop computer. Earlier this year I had the opportunity to build my first ever desktop computer. It required a lot of deciding on what components I wanted and how they will benefit my production in work and play. Building a new PC is kind of like a form of Design Patterns because it requires us to seek for the best and most optimized for our own budget. The decision on what component you want to buy has to satisfy and work with every other component. This is like how in Object Oriented Design Patterns require some sort of interaction between different classes. The analogy between building a PC and Design Pattern is that they all hope to achieve one goal; to find the best and most efficient solution.  

There are many different types of design patterns that can be used for our own advantage. But the four most common are Factory, Single, Observer, and MVC. These design patterns will have their own list of advantages and disadvantages. Just like how you build a PC, one component may be better than the other but it can also be way too expensive. All these design patterns require a lot of understanding because you might be using the wrong type which in return can display many more problems. 

## I used a design pattern??

For all computer scientists, we have worked with a design pattern whether you like it or not. This actually surprised me because of the fact that we wrote huge amounts of code without knowing that we've actually used a design pattern. A more recent example of a project that I am currently working on with my group, would be our final project called "Manoa Eats" (soon to be published under my projects collection for you to view). Our final project uses the design pattern of MVC, Model-Viewing-Controller.
