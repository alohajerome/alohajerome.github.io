## Do you ask "Stupid Questions"?

We've all been victims of asking questions that are very straight forward. And eventually we get help or figure it out on own. In my opinion, whenever I ask those type of questions, I tend to feel embarrassed and keep to myself for the rest of class time. Through the readings from [How to ask questions the smart way] (http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), we'll always see "stupid questions" that are asked because we are all human beings that will usually seek for shortcuts. I am not saying that everyone asks stupid question, but there will always be a time where you won't even think that your question is not that bright.
