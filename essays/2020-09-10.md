## Do you ask "Stupid Questions"?

We've all been victims of asking questions that are very straight forward. And eventually we get help or figure it out on own. In my opinion, whenever I ask those type of questions, I tend to feel embarrassed and keep to myself for the rest of class time. Through the readings from [How to ask questions the smart way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), we'll always see "stupid questions" that are asked because we are all human beings that will usually seek for shortcuts. I am not saying that everyone asks stupid question, but there will always be a time where you won't even think that your question is not that bright.

## Thinking about our Questions

If everyone stopped and thought about how they would ask questions intelligently, I'd think that we'd probably get answers quickly and informatively. To show you an example of a question that has been asked the right way, we turn to StackOverflow, a Q & A website for all aspiring programmers. 

For this example, I'll show you how this is the right way to ask a question: [Getting “The entity type model is not part of the model for the current context.”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22394603/getting-the-entity-type-model-is-not-part-of-the-model-for-the-current-contex)
